Types of Public Notices in India:

India is a secular country which is for the people, by the people &amp; the leaders are dedicated to the service of the people. In a country where the emphasis is so much on the public, the public notice ads is a very important ad in the newspaper.

In general terms public notice is some information which makes the public aware about something. These are usually given by either the company, government or any other entity. These notices can be of various lengths &amp; can include text or images &amp; sometimes even both. There are various reasons for which you may need to publish public notice ad in newspapers.

A few reasons could be

Making a property deal : When you are making a property deal, it involves more than 2 people &amp; it’s a tedious task. Also it brings in legal matters &amp; involvement of police, courts, etc. as sometimes there can be disputes while making a property deal as the cost of property is on the rise. So a public notice ad can help making the process more transparent.

Father / mother dies without making any nomination : These days with a lot of uncertainty in life, there is a possibility that there can be a death of our father/mother &amp; they have not had a chance to make a nomination. In cases like these sometimes there can be a fight between brothers or relatives as they could be the legal heir but would not want to share the property. Rather than leading to any issues, it is better to go the Public Notice way so that everyone gets their part.</NoticeDesc>
